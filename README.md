# NMRAMembers

NMRAMembers is a Python 3 program used to take the NMRA Membership ZIP file that is sent out each month by national to the region and distribute all of the individual division member rosters to a representative from each division.

The Python program can be run from the command line using python3 or it can be compiled using pyinstaller for a user's platform.
